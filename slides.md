* All or nothing solution
* Grails 3 will use gradle as the build system

~~
### Gradle Multi Project Build

Gradle really shines at multi-project build. 

~~~~
## Groovy

Groovy is bigger then just Grails. There are many new features that have been added recently.

~~
### @DelegatesTo

This new annotation allows for better DSLs to be built. Using this annotation along with static compilation you can type check your DSLs. If you are using IDEA you even get autocomplete.

[@DelegatesTo Docs](http://groovy.codehaus.org/The+@DelegatesTo+annotation)
[Example Usage](https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/blob/master/ratpack-groovy/src/main/java/org/ratpackframework/groovy/handling/ClosureHandlers.java)

~~
### Meta Annotations

* Allows rolling up annotations. 
* Set defaults for annotation parameters.

[Docs](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Meta-annotations)

## Grails

Many great talks and the area I gave my talks in.

### Transactions

A proxy object for services adds the transactional functionality but that means you can't call new Server() and get transactions.

## Ratpack

A new micro framework. Like sinatra. Allows a single file webapp using @Grab.

### Example Single Page App

    @GrabResolver("https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/repo")
    @Grab("org.ratpack-framework:ratpack-groovy:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT")
    import static org.ratpackframework.groovy.RatpackScript.ratpack
    import org.ratpackframework.groovy.templating.TemplateRenderer

    ratpack {
        handlers {
            get {
                response.send "This is the app root (also try: /date and /some.txt)"
            }

            get("date") { 
             response.send "Hey date area"
           }
        }
    }
